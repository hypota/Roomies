    <p><b>Creator's log! This is where you'll find info on development and struggles and stuff (WARNING: I might start trauma dumping and venting, so be warned.)</b></p>
    <p><b>DAY ONE: Not exactly first day of working, but it's been going good on eps. 3. My friend is working on animating the fight scene for episode 3. I PROMISE it won't be like Monika IRL.</b></p>
    <p><b>DAY TWO: My friend got sick at the worst possible time. I'm gonna start production on eps. 4, so expect an earlier episode 4 release.</b></p>
